To do so, three sensor systems were integrated in the car and four relevant emotional states of the driver were defined: neutral, positive, frustrated and anxious. To gather as natural as possible emotional data of the driver, the subjects needed to be unbiased and were therefore kept unaware of the detailed research objective. The emotions were induced using so-called Wizard-of-Oz experiments, where the drivers believed to be interacting with an automated technical system, which in fact was controlled by a human. Additionally, on board interviews while driving were conducted by an instructed psychologist. To evaluate the collected data, questionnaires were filled out by the subjects before, during and after the data collection. These included monitoring of the drivers perceived state of emotion, stress, sleepiness and thermal sensation but also detailed questionnaires on their driving experience, attitude towards technology and big five OCEAN personality traits. Afterwards, the data was annotated by expert labelers. Exemplary results of the evaluation of the experiments are given in the result section of this paper.

Compared with commonly used positional encoding schemes, CSPAN can exploit the interaction between semantics and word positions in a more interpretable and adaptive manner, and the classification performance can be notably improved while simultaneously preserving a compact model size and high convergence rate.

Our primary innovation that enables us to do this efficiently is a new control structure for sequential neural networks-the stack long short-term memory unit LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsers, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. Our model captures three facets of the parser's state: i unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, ii the complete history of transition actions taken by the parser, and iii the complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including their internal structures. In addition, we compare two different word representations: i standard word vectors based on look-up tables and ii character-based models of words. Although standard word embedding models work well in all languages, the character-based models improve the handling of out-of-vocabulary words, particularly in morphologically rich languages. Finally, we discuss the use of dynamic oracles in training the parser. During training, dynamic oracles alternate between sampling parser states from the training data and from the model as it is being learned, making the model more robust to the kinds of errors that will be made at test time.

This preprocessing prevents the model from handling some contextual effects and from managing multiple occurrences of the same attribute. Our approach uses a character-level model, which unlike the word-level model makes it possible to learn to ""copy"" information from the dialog act to the target without having to pre-process the input.

This is motivated by an actual system under development to assist in the order taking process. We develop a sequence-tosequence model that is able to map from unstructured conversational input to the structured form that is conveyed to the kitchen and appears on the customer receipt. This problem is critically different from other tasks like machine translation where sequence-to-sequence models have been used: the input includes two sides of a conversation; the output is highly structured; and logical manipulations must be performed, for example when the customer changes his mind while ordering. We present a novel sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates a special attention-memory gating mechanism and conversational role markers. The proposed model improves performance over both a phrase-based machine translation approach and a standard sequence-to-sequence model. Hi, how can I help you ? We'd like a large cheese pizza.

Many economies are facing ultra-low interest rate environments ever since the global financial crisis of 2007-9. The Covid pandemic recently reinforced this situation. In the US and Europe, interest rates are close to or even below zero, which limits the scope of traditional monetary policy measures for central banks. Dedicated central bank communication has hence become an increasingly important tool to steer and control market expectations these days. However, incorporating central bank language directly as features into economic models is still a very nascent research area. In particular, the content and effect of central bank speeches has been mostly neglected from monetary policy modelling so far. With our paper, we aim to provide to the research community a novel, monetary policy shock series based on central bank speeches. We use a supervised topic modeling approach that can deal with text as well as numeric covariates to estimate a monetary policy signal dispersion index along three key economic dimensions: GDP, CPI and unemployment. This ""dispersion shock"" series is not only more frequent than series that classically focus on policy announcement dates, it also opens up the possibility of answering new questions that have up until now been difficult to analyse. For example, do markets form different expectations when facing a ""cacophony of policy voices""? Our initial findings for the US point towards the fact that more dispersed or incongruent monetary policy stance communication in the build up to Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meetings might be associated with stronger subsequent market surprises at FOMC policy announcement time.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.econlp-1.12,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,November,Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Economics and Natural Language Processing,"Ahrens, Maximilian  and

However, there has been relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of humanannotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses. Our methods lead to significant improvements in both structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to other similar graph generation tasks.

We find that i there is a positive correlation between the informational support given in posts and the emotional support given and emotional support sought, respectively, in these posts and ii over time, users tended to seek more emotional support and give less emotional support.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.louhi-1.3,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,April,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis,"Andy, Anietie  and

The investigation of the SICK corpus was a necessary task to check the quality of the testing data which is to be used as a golden standard for the new system. This checking also provides crucial insights for the implementation of the components of the system. The investigation showed that the human judgements used in the building of the SICK corpus can be erroneous, in this way deteriorating the quality of an otherwise useful resource. We also show that detecting the relationship between some pairs of the SICK corpus requires more than just lexical semantics, which provides us with guidelines and intuitions for our further implementation.",https://aclanthology.org/W17-6915,,2017,,{IWCS} 2017 {---} 12th International Conference on Computational Semantics {---} Short papers,"Kalouli, Aikaterini-Lida  and

Particularly, bilexical deep dependency structures beyond surface tree representation can be derived from linguistic analysis grounded by CCG, LFG, and HPSG. Traditionally, these dependency structures are obtained as a by-product of grammar-guided parsers. In this article, we study the alternative data-driven, transition-based approach, which has achieved great success for tree parsing, to build general dependency graphs. We integrate existing tree parsing techniques and present two new transition systems that can generate arbitrary directed graphs in an incremental manner. Statistical parsers that are competitive in both accuracy and efficiency can be built upon these transition systems. Furthermore, the heterogeneous design of transition systems yields diversity of the corresponding parsing models and thus greatly benefits parser ensemble. Concerning the disambiguation problem, we introduce two new techniques, namely, transition combination and tree approximation, to improve parsing quality. Transition combination makes every action performed by a parser significantly change configurations. Therefore, more distinct features can be extracted for statistical disambiguation. With the same goal of extracting informative features, tree approximation induces tree backbones from dependency graphs and re-uses tree parsing techniques to produce tree-related features. We conduct experiments on CCG-grounded functor-argument analysis, LFG-grounded grammatical relation analysis, and HPSG-grounded semantic dependency analysis for English and Chinese.

A human evaluation of the generated dialogue lines reveals that utterances generated by the multi-tasking models were subjectively rated as the most typical, most moving the conversation forward, and least offensive. Based on these promising first results, we discuss future research directions for incorporating subjective human evaluations into language model training and to hence keep the human user in the loop during the development process.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.humeval-1.2,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,April,Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems (HumEval),"Nyberg, Jakob  and

Our data show that there are two contexts for devoicing in Romanian: before a voiceless obstruent, which means that there is regressive voicelessness assimilation in the language, and before pause, which means that there is a tendency towards final devoicing proper. The data also show that non-canonical voicing is an instance of voicing assimilation, as it is observed mainly before voiced consonants voiced obstruents and sonorants alike. Two conclusions can be drawn from our analyses. First, from a phonetic point of view, the two devoicing phenomena exhibit the same behavior regarding place of articulation of the coda, while voicing assimilation displays the reverse tendency. In particular, alveolars, which tend to devoice the most, also voice the least. Second, the two assimilation processes have similarities that could distinguish them from final devoicing as such. Final devoicing seems to be sensitive to speech style and gender of the speaker, while assimilation processes do not. This may indicate that the two kinds of processes are phonologized at two different degrees in the language, final devoicing being more sociolinguistically stigmatized than assimilation.",https://aclanthology.org/2020.sltu-1.31,European Language Resources association,2020,May,Proceedings of the 1st Joint Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-resourced languages (SLTU) and Collaboration and Computing for Under-Resourced Languages (CCURL),"Hutin, Mathilde  and

2021.semspace-1.3,"['Data Management and Generation', 'Knowledge Representation and Reasoning']",['Data Preparation'],,"While the DisCoCat model Coecke et al., 2010 has been proved a valuable tool for studying compositional aspects of language at the level of semantics, its strong dependency on pregroup grammars poses important restrictions: first, it prevents large-scale experimentation due to the absence of a pregroup parser; and second, it limits the expressibility of the model to context-free grammars. In this paper we solve these problems by reformulating DisCoCat as a passage from Combinatory Categorial Grammar CCG to a category of semantics. We start by showing that standard categorial grammars can be expressed as a biclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity; we then proceed to model permutation-inducing rules by exploiting the symmetry of the compact closed category encoding the word meaning. We provide a proof of concept for our method, converting ""Alice in Wonderland"" into DisCoCat form, a corpus that we make available to the community. man, 1987, 1996. We achieve this by encoding CCG as a biclosed category, where all standard order-preserving rules of the grammar find a natural translation into biclosed diagrams. CCG rules whose purpose is to relax word ordering and allow cross-serial dependencies are encoded as special morphisms. We then define a closed monoidal functor from the biclosed category freely generated over a set of atomic types, a set of words, and the set of arrows encoding the special rules of the grammar to a compact-closed category. We show that since the category of the semantics is symmetric, the special rules that allow word permutation can be encoded efficiently using the mechanism of ""swapping the wires"". As we will see in Section 3, while in the past there were other attempts to represent CCG in DisCoCat using similar methods Grefenstette, 2013, this is the first time that a complete and theoretically sound treatment is provided and implemented in practice. By presenting a version of DisCoCat which is no longer bound to pregroups, we achieve two important outcomes. First, since CCG is shown to be a mildly context-sensitive grammar Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994, we increase the generative power of DisCoCat accordingly; and second, due to the availability of many robust CCG parsers that can be used for obtaining the derivations of sentences in large datasets -see, for example Clark and Curran, 2007 -we make large-scale DisCoCat experiments on sentences of arbitrary grammatical structures possible for the first time. In fact, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by using a standard CCG parser Yoshikawa et al., 2017 to obtain derivations for all sentences in the book ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", which we then convert to DisCoCat diagrams based on the theory described in this paper. This resource -the first in its kind -is now available to the DisCoCat community for facilitating research and experiments. Furthermore, a web-based tool that allows the conversion of any sentence into a DisCoCat diagram is available at CQC's QNLP website. 2",https://aclanthology.org/2021.semspace-1.3,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,June,"Proceedings of the 2021 Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics, and Cognitive Science (SemSpace)","Yeung, Richie  and

Research questions like what knowledge is transferred or whether the transferred knowledge can help answer over one source using another one, are yet to be answered. In this paper, therefore, we study the knowledge transfer of multi-hop reasoning between structured and unstructured sources. We first propose a unified QA framework named SIMULTQA to enable knowledge transfer and bridge the distinct supervisions from KB and text sources. Then, we conduct extensive analyses to explore how knowledge is transferred by leveraging the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. We focus on the low-resource finetuning to show that pre-training SIMULTQA on one source can substantially improve its performance on the other source.

The LSTM-RNN model uses pretrained word embeddings learned from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences into speech act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem of limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model to learn from synchronous conversations e.g., meetings, using domain adversarial training of neural networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: i LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations, ii conversational word embeddings benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf ones, iii adversarial training gives better domain-invariant representations, and iv the global CRF model improves over local models.",https://aclanthology.org/J18-4012,MIT Press,2018,December,,"Joty, Shafiq  and

We argue that previous models that encode local representations of words cannot capture global context shifts such as the context shift of face masks since the pandemic outbreak. We experiment with neural topic models to track context shifts of words. We show that this approach can reveal textual associations of words that go beyond their lexical meaning representation.

We conclude that one large obstacle both for deriving predicate-argument structures from UD treebanks and for the automatic enhancement of basic UD treebanks is the fact that UD does not represent empty elements such as pro-dropped arguments, and we suggest that devoting effort to this would often provide a better return on investment than spending resources on improving or adding E-UD annotations.

In particular, the focus was on two types of compounds: compounds interpreted by semantic relations or by functional properties between constituents. We collected 880 compounds from a dictionary and categorized them into two types of noun-noun compounds in Mandarin, including relation-based compounds e.g., 中國菜 zhōngguócài ""Chinese food"" and functional property-based compounds e.g., 柳 葉 眉 liǔyèméi ""arched eyebrows"". Finally, the frequency of occurrence of the two types of compounds was determined. The results showed that relation-based compounds occurred much more frequently than property-based compounds in our data 96.1% vs. 3.8%. In addition, it was found that within the relation-based compounds, noun-noun compounds using the FOR relation e.g., 信紙 xìnzhǐ ""letter paper"" had the highest rates of occurrence 37.6%, while the CAUSE relation e.g., 刀傷 dāoshāng ""wounds by a knife"" had the lowest rates of occurrence 0.7%. On the other hand, the functional property-based compounds, almost always referring to objects in the NATURAL KIND domain, take metaphorical meanings from individual constituents. Our study suggests that the relation-based meanings for interpreting compounds are common in daily conversation, which could be the dominant strategy people use to interpret novel compounds.

However, equally important for language processing is the ability to combine words into phrasal constituents, and use constituent-level features to drive downstream expectations. Here we investigate neural models' ability to represent constituent-level features, using coordinated noun phrases as a case study. We assess whether different neural language models trained on English and French represent phrase-level number and gender features, and use those features to drive downstream expectations. Our results suggest that models use a linear combination of NP constituent number to drive CoordNP/verb number agreement. This behavior is highly regular and even sensitive to local syntactic context, however it differs crucially from observed human behavior. Models have less success with gender agreement.

Significant research effort has been devoted to experimentally probe the inner workings of Transformers. However, our conceptual and theoretical understanding of their power and inherent limitations is still nascent. In particular, the roles of various components in Transformers such as positional encodings, attention heads, residual connections, and feedforward networks, are not clear. In this paper, we take a step towards answering these questions. We analyze the computational power as captured by Turing-completeness. We first provide an alternate and simpler proof to show that vanilla Transformers are Turing-complete and then we prove that Transformers with only positional masking and without any positional encoding are also Turing-complete. We further analyze the necessity of each component for the Turing-completeness of the network; interestingly, we find that a particular type of residual connection is necessary.

With the simple addition and subtraction operation, we introduce a twin-gated mechanism to build input and forget gates which are highly correlated. Despite this simplification, the essential non-linearities and capability of modeling long-distance dependencies are preserved. Additionally, the proposed ATR is more transparent than LSTM/GRU due to the simplification. Forward self-attention can be easily established in ATR, which makes the proposed network interpretable. Experiments on WMT14 translation tasks demonstrate that ATR-based neural machine translation can yield competitive performance on English-German and English-French language pairs in terms of both translation quality and speed.

Although pre-trained BERT models are available, GPU-dependency, large memory requirement, and data scarcity often limit their applicability. As a solution, this paper proposes a fusion chain architecture comprised of one or more layers of CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM and identifies precise configuration and chain length. The study shows that a simpler, CPU-trainable non-BERT fusion CNN + BiLSTM + CNN is sufficient to surpass the textual classification performance of the BERT-related models in resource-limited languages and environments. The fusion architecture competitively approaches the state-of-the-art accuracy in several Bengali NLP tasks and a six-class emotion detection task for a newly developed Bengali dataset. Interestingly, the performance of the identified fusion model, for instance, CNN + BiLSTM + CNN, also holds for other lowresource languages and environments. Efficacy study shows that the CNN + BiLSTM + CNN model outperforms BERT implementation for Vietnamese languages and performs almost equally in English NLP tasks experiencing artificial data scarcity. For the GLUE benchmark and other datasets such as Emotion, IMDB, and Intent classification, the CNN + BiLSTM + CNN model often surpasses or competes with BERT-base, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, and mBERT. Besides, a position-sensitive selfattention layer role further improves the fusion models' performance in the Bengali emotion classification.

Achieving this representation can be done via learning, where both the world representation and the language grounding are learned simultaneously. However, in robotics this can be a difficult task due to the cost and scarcity of data. In this paper, we tackle the problem by separately learning the world representation of the robot and the language grounding. While this approach can address the challenges in getting sufficient data, it may give rise to inconsistencies between both learned components.

In this paper, we describe in detail a novel domain adaptation mechanism in neural network training. Instead of learning and adapting the neural network on millions of training sentences -which can be very timeconsuming or even infeasible in some cases -we design a domain adaptation gating mechanism which can be used in recurrent neural networks and quickly learn the out-of-domain knowledge directly from the word vector representations with little speed overhead. In our experiments, we use the recurrent neural network language model LM as a case study. We show that the neural LM perplexity can be reduced by 7.395 and 12.011 using the proposed domain adaptation mechanism on the Penn Treebank and News data, respectively. Furthermore, we show that using the domain-adapted neural LM to re-rank the statistical machine translation n-best list on the French-to-English language pair can significantly improve translation quality.",https://aclanthology.org/C16-1131,The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee,2016,December,"Proceedings of {COLING} 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers","Zhang, Jian  and

Since the 2016 US presidential election, the term ""fake news"" became increasingly popular and this phenomenon has received more attention. In the past years several fact-checking agencies were created, but due to the great number of daily posts on social media, manual checking is insufficient. Currently, there is a pressing need for automatic fake news detection tools, either to assist manual fact-checkers or to operate as standalone tools. There are several projects underway on this topic, but most of them focus on English. This research-in-progress paper discusses the employment of deep learning methods, and the development of a tool, for detecting false news in Portuguese. As a first step we shall compare well-established architectures that were tested in other languages and analyse their performance on our Portuguese data. Based on the preliminary results of these classifiers, we shall choose a deep learning model or combine several deep learning models which hold promise to enhance the performance of our fake news detection system.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.triton-1.16,INCOMA Ltd.,2021,July,Proceedings of the Translation and Interpreting Technology Online Conference,"Venturott, L{\'\i}gia  and

The task is challenging due to the large search space and spuriousness of logical forms. In this paper we introduce a neural parser-ranker system for weakly-supervised semantic parsing. The parser generates candidate tree-structured logical forms from utterances using clues of denotations. These candidates are then ranked based on two criterion: their likelihood of executing to the correct denotation, and their agreement with the utterance semantics. We present a scheduled training procedure to balance the contribution of the two objectives. Furthermore, we propose to use a neurally encoded lexicon to inject prior domain knowledge to the model. Experiments on three Freebase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our semantic parser, achieving results within the state-of-the-art range.",https://aclanthology.org/K18-1035,Association for Computational Linguistics,2018,October,Proceedings of the 22nd Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,"Cheng, Jianpeng  and

Particularly intriguing is their ability to identify and encode conceptual abstractions. Past work has probed BERT representations Devlin et al., 2019 for this competence, finding that BERT can correctly retrieve noun hypernyms in cloze tasks. In this work, we ask the question: do probing studies shed light on systematic knowledge in BERT representations? As a case study, we examine hypernymy knowledge encoded in BERT representations. In particular, we demonstrate through a simple consistency probe that the ability to correctly retrieve hypernyms in cloze tasks, as used in prior work, does not correspond to systematic knowledge in BERT. Our main conclusion is cautionary: even if BERT demonstrates high probing accuracy for a particular competence, it does not necessarily follow that BERT 'understands' a concept, and it cannot be expected to systematically generalize across applicable contexts. 1",https://aclanthology.org/2020.starsem-1.10,Association for Computational Linguistics,2020,December,Proceedings of the Ninth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics,"Ravichander, Abhilasha  and

2020.dt4tp-1.1,"['Parsing', 'Dialogue Systems']","['Discourse Parsing', 'Chatbots']",,"In many task-oriented chatbot domains, an objective is to fully inform a user about a particular important piece of information. It is also crucial to make user believe this piece of information, relying on explanation and argumentation in as much degree as possible. In some cases, it is important to make a user believe in a particular short text. This should be done by thoroughly navigating a user through possible disagreements and misunderstanding, to make sure the user is being explained and communicated an issue exhaustively. Rather than throwing the whole paragraph of text at a user, we split it into logical parts and feed the user text fragment by fragment, following her interests and intents. To systematically implement this navigation, we follow a discourse-level structure for how the author of this text organized his thoughts. This can be done by navigating a discourse tree DT of this text. DT is a tree that is a labeled tree in which the leaves of the tree correspond to contiguous units for clauses elementary discourse units, EDUs. Adjacent EDUs, as well as higher-level larger discourse units, are organized in a hierarchy by rhetorical relation e.g., Reason, Temporal sequence provided by Rhetorical structure theory RST, Mann and Thompson, 1988. An anti-symmetric relation involves a pair of EDUs: nuclei, which are core parts of the relation, and satellites, which are the supportive parts of the rhetorical relation. A satellite can be delivered by the chatbot to a user as an utterance only if its nucleus has already been received and acknowledged in one way or another. We outline the chatbot algorithm of the DT traversal, covering a multitude of user intents at each iteration: 1. If a text is given, navigating a discourse tree of this text T is one of the most efficient ways to communicate it. The chatbot starts with making an introduction and then making the main statement M T . Then the user would ask for more details E T , disagree E T or ask a question on a topic outside of the scope of this text O T . 2. If the user asks for more details I T , the EDU connected with Elaboration with M T is provided as a reply. We denote this EDU as ElaborationI T . This is the easiest, most direct situation. 3. If the user disagrees, chatbot tries to find an EDU which is connected by Explanation or Cause with M T or I T. This EDU should be returned as a reply. 4. If the user asks a different question O T then it should be answered as a factoid question but nevertheless the chatbot needs to take the user back to T so the reply should end with ElaborationI T . If the user doubts about the validity of a claim in M T , the chatbot needs to deliver AttributionM T  as an answer. The procedure above should iterate till no more EDU in T is left or the user terminates the conversation. If the chatbot persistence is too high in trying to take the user back to T, this user would terminate the conversation too soon. Otherwise, if the chatbot persistence is too low, the user would deviate from T too far so will red less content of T EDUT. We want to optimize the chatbot to maintain the optimal persistence to maximize the number of delivered EDUT till the conversation is abandoned by the user. Let us take a text and show how a DT navigation leads a dialogue wrapped around this text.

A top diplomat in the UK, Chen Wen explained the BBC the demands were politically motivated and would divert China attention from fighting the pandemic.

At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -that ""women candidates are less qualified."" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover SOCIAL BIAS FRAMES from unstructured text.

Manual verification of the extracted annotations yields an accuracy rate of 97.5%, compared to 70.7% for relations extracted from object detection and 31.5% for automatically generated captions. Our method also produces a rich set of features, providing more unique labels 1170 than either the captions 1040 or object detection 178 methods. We conclude by describing directions for a linguistically-focused ontology of region categories that can better enrich historical image data.

In the first study, the most frequent and characteristic lemmas in the manifestos of the political parties as well as their language complexity are analysed. The analysis shows inter alia that the most frequently occurring lemmas in the manifestos reflect either the ideology or the position of the parties towards specific subjects, confirming for Danish preceding studies of English and German manifestos. Successively, we scaled our analysis applying NLP methods to the transcribed speeches by members of the same parties in the Parliament Hansards and trained machine learning algorithms in order to determine to what extent it is possible to predict the party of the politicians from the speeches. The speeches are a subset of the Danish Parliament corpus 2009-2017. The best results of the classification experiments gave a weighted F1-score of 0.57. These results are significantly better than the results obtained by the majority classifier weighted F1-score = 0.11 and by chance results.

A key challenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data are extremely scarce, and the annotation ability of existing distant or weak supervision approaches is very limited. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT Masked Language Model MLM. Given a mention in a sentence, our approach constructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent hypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated labels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved substantially.

Also, the relation types between the implicitly connected entity pairs can be identified with relational reasoning patterns in the real world.

Teachers must be convinced of the pedagogical benefits of a particular curriculum before they will agree to learn the means to teach it. The teaching of formal grammar to first language students in schools is no exception to this rule. Over the last three decades, most schools in England have been legally required to teach grammatical subject knowledge, i.e. linguistic knowledge of grammar terms and structure, to children age five and upwards as part of the national curriculum in English. A mandatory set of curriculum specifications for England and Wales was published in 2014, and elsewhere similar requirements were imposed. However, few current English school teachers were taught grammar themselves, and the dominant view has long been in favour of 'real books' rather than the teaching of a formal grammar. English grammar teaching thus faces multiple challenges: to convince teachers of the value of grammar in their own teaching, to teach the teachers the knowledge they need, and to develop relevant resources to use in the classroom.

Therefore asking students to provide feedback to each other has become one way to support learning. This peer-to-peer feedback has become increasingly important whether in MOOCs to provide feedback to thousands of students or in large-scale classes at universities. One of the challenges when allowing peer-to-peer feedback is that the feedback should be perceived as helpful, and an import factor determining helpfulness is how specific the feedback is. However, in classes including thousands of students, instructors do not have the resources to check the specificity of every piece of feedback between students. Therefore, we present an automatic classification model to measure sentence specificity in written feedback. The model was trained and tested on student feedback texts written in German where sentences have been labelled as general or specific. We find that we can automatically classify the sentences with an accuracy of 76.7% using a conventional feature-based approach, whereas transfer learning with BERT for German gives a classification accuracy of 81.1%. However, the feature-based approach comes with lower computational costs and preserves human interpretability of the coefficients.

In some Artificial Intelligence problems, such as Computer Vision tasks, the goal is to obtain objective labels. However, in problems such as text and sentiment analysis, subjective labelling is often required. More so when the sentiment analysis deals with actual emotions instead of polarity positive/negative . Scientists employ human experts to create these labels, but it is costly and time consuming. Crowdsourcing enables researchers to utilise non-expert knowledge for scientific tasks. From image analysis to semantic annotation, interested researchers can gather a large sample of answers via crowdsourcing platforms in a timely manner. However, non-expert contributions often need to be thoroughly assessed, particularly so when a task is subjective. Researchers have traditionally used 'Gold Standard', 'Thresholding' and 'Majority Voting' as methods to filter non-expert contributions. We argue that these methods are unsuitable for subjective tasks, such as lexicon acquisition and sentiment analysis. We discuss subjectivity in human centered tasks and present a filtering method that defines quality contributors, based on a set of objectively infused terms in a lexicon acquisition task. We evaluate our method against an established lexicon, the diversity of emotions -i.e. subjectivity-and the exclusion of contributions.

In realworld matching practices, it is often observed that with the training goes on, the feature vectors projected from different domains tend to be indistinguishable. The phenomenon, however, is often overlooked in existing matching models. As a result, the feature vectors are constructed without any regularization, which inevitably increases the difficulty of learning the downstream matching functions. In this paper, we propose a novel match method tailored for text matching in asymmetrical domains, called WD-Match. In WD-Match, a Wasserstein distance-based regularizer is defined to regularize the features vectors projected from different domains. As a result, the method enforces the feature projection function to generate vectors such that those correspond to different domains cannot be easily discriminated. The training process of WD-Match amounts to a game that minimizes the matching loss regularized by the Wasserstein distance. WD-Match can be used to improve different text matching methods, by using the method as its underlying matching model. Four popular text matching methods have been exploited in the paper.

Most spell checkers automatically detect spelling mistakes by looking up individual words and seeing if they exist in the vocabulary. However, one of the biggest challenges of automatic spelling correction is how to deal with real-word errors, i.e. spelling mistakes which lead to a real but unintended word, such as when then is written in place of than. These errors account for 20% of all spelling mistakes made by people with dyslexia. As both words exist in the vocabulary, a simple dictionary lookup will not detect the mistake. The only way to disambiguate which word was actually intended is to look at the context in which the word appears. This problem is particularly apparent in languages with rich morphology where there is often minimal orthographic difference between grammatical items.

We can then solve efficiently the problem of multi-label learning with an intractably large number of interdependent labels, such as automatic tagging of Wikipedia pages. We propose a submodular maximization framework with linear cost to find informative labels which are most relevant to other labels yet least redundant with each other. A simple prediction model can then be trained on this label subset. Our framework includes both labellabel and label-feature dependencies, which aims to find the labels with the most representation and prediction ability. In addition, to avoid information loss, we extract and predict outlier labels with weak dependency on other labels.

EXCORD first generates self-contained questions that can be understood without the conversation history, then trains a QA model with the pairs of original and self-contained questions using a consistency-based regularizer.

In Information Retrieval or Dialogue Generation, normalization of user queries or utterances enhances linguistic understanding by translating non-canonical text to its canonical form, on which many state-of-the-art language models are trained. On the other hand, text sanitization removes sensitive information to guarantee user privacy and anonymity. Existing approaches to normalization and sanitization mainly rely on hand-crafted heuristics and syntactic features of individual tokens while disregarding the linguistic context. Moreover, such context-unaware solutions cannot dynamically determine whether out-of-vocab tokens are misspelt or are entity names. In this work, we formulate text normalization and sanitization as a multi-task text generation approach and propose a neural pointer-generator network based on multihead attention. Its generator effectively captures linguistic context during normalization and sanitization while its pointer dynamically preserves the entities that are generally missing in the vocabulary. Experiments show that our generation approach outperforms both token-based text normalization and sanitization, while the pointer-generator improves the generator-only baseline in terms of BLEU4 score, and classical attentional pointer networks in terms of pointing accuracy.",https://aclanthology.org/2020.nli-1.5,Association for Computational Linguistics,2020,July,Proceedings of the First Workshop on Natural Language Interfaces,"Nguyen, Hoang  and

Predictive accuracy on this task can supplement additional analyses beyond hate speech detection, motivating its study. Using the Measuring Hate Speech corpus, which provided annotations for targeted identity groups on roughly 50,000 social media comments, we create neural network models to perform multi-label binary prediction of identity groups targeted by a social media comment. Specifically, we study 8 broad identity groups and 12 identity sub-groups within race and gender identity. We find that these networks exhibited good predictive performance, achieving ROC AUCs of greater than 0.9 and PR AUCs of greater than 0.7 on several identity groups. At the same time, we find performance suffered on identity groups less represented in the dataset. We validate model performance on the HateCheck and Gab Hate Corpora, finding that predictive performance generalizes in most settings. We additionally examine the performance of the model on comments targeting multiple identity groups.

This feature provides the LSTM family with additional information in predictions, compared to regular Recurrent Neural Networks RNNs and Bag-of-Words BOW models. In other words, LSTM networks assume the data to be chain-structured. The longer the distance between two data points, the less related the data points are. However, this is usually not the case for real multimedia signals including text, sound and music. In real data, this chain-structured dependency exists only across meaningful groups of data units but not over single units directly. For example, in a prediction task over sound signals, a meaningful word could give a strong hint to its following word as a whole but not the first phoneme of that word. This undermines the ability of LSTM networks in modeling multimedia data, which is pattern-rich. In this paper we take advantage of Seq2Tree network, a dynamically extensible tree-structured neural network architecture which helps solve the problem LSTM networks face in sound signal processing tasks-the unbalanced connections among data units inside and outside semantic groups.

In this work, we are interested in the scientific question of whether explicit script knowledge is present and accessible through pre-trained generative language models LMs. To this end, we introduce the task of generating full event sequence descriptions ESDs given a scenario as a natural language prompt. Through zero-shot probing, we find that generative LMs produce poor ESDs with mostly omitted, irrelevant, repeated or misordered events. To address this, we propose a pipeline-based script induction framework SIF which can generate good quality ESDs for unseen scenarios e.g., bake a cake. SIF is a two-staged framework that fine-tunes LM on a small set of ESD examples in the first stage. In the second stage, ESD generated for an unseen scenario is post-processed using RoBERTa-based models to filter irrelevant events, remove repetitions, and reorder the temporally misordered events. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we demonstrate that SIF yields substantial improvements 1-3 BLEU points over a fine-tuned LM.

By tracking the optimization dynamics, we observe the encoder-decoder incompatibility that leads to poor parameterizations of the data manifold. We argue that the trivial local optimum may be avoided by improving the encoder and decoder parameterizations since the posterior network is part of a transition map between them. To this end, we propose Coupled-VAE, which couples a VAE model with a deterministic autoencoder with the same structure and improves the encoder and decoder parameterizations via encoder weight sharing and decoder signal matching. We apply the proposed Coupled-VAE approach to various VAE models with different regularization, posterior family, decoder structure, and optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets i.e., PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo show consistently improved results in terms of probability estimation and richness of the latent space. We also generalize our method to conditional language modeling and propose Coupled-CVAE, which largely improves the diversity of dialogue generation on the Switchboard dataset. 1",https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.316,Association for Computational Linguistics,2020,July,Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,"Wu, Chen  and

The proposed approach proceeds in two steps. First, the real estate reports and their associated summaries are automatically labelled using a set of heuristic rules gathered from human experts and aggregated using weak supervision. The aggregated labels are then employed to learn a neural model that takes a document and its summary as inputs and outputs a score reflecting the predicted quality of the summary. The neural model maps the document and its summary to a shared ""summary content space"" and computes the cosine similarity between the two document embeddings to predict the final summary quality score. The best performance is achieved by a CNN-based model with an accuracy measured against the aggregated labels obtained via weak supervision of 89.5%, compared to 72.6% for the best unsupervised model. Manual inspection of examples indicate that the weak supervision labels do capture important indicators of summary quality, but the correlation of those labels with human judgements remains to be validated.

Our results show that different criteria result in different disagreements, and indicate that a clear definition of quality criterion can improve the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, our results show that for certain linguistic phenomena which are not limited to one or two words such as word ambiguity or gender but span over several words or even entire phrases such as negation or relative clause, disagreements do not necessarily represent ""errors"" or ""noise"" but are rather inherent to the evaluation process. On the other hand, for some other phenomena such as omission or verb forms agreement can be easily improved by providing more precise and detailed instructions to the evaluators.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.conll-1.18,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,November,Proceedings of the 25th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,"Popovi{\'c}, Maja",Agree to Disagree: Analysis of Inter-Annotator Disagreements in Human Evaluation of Machine Translation Output,10.18653/v1/2021.conll-1.18,conll,587

In Resolution Prediction, a system attributes a given relationship outlook to a particular resolution that explains the outcome. These two tasks parallel two real-life questions that people frequently ponder upon as they navigate different social situations: ""where is this relationship going?"" and ""how did we end up here?"". To facilitate the investigation of human social relationships through these two tasks, we construct a new dataset, Social Narrative Tree, which consists of 1250 stories documenting a variety of daily social interactions. The narratives encode a multitude of social elements that interweave to give rise to rich commonsense knowledge of how relationships evolve with respect to social interactions.

User queries and CQA pairs differ significantly in language characteristics making relevance learning difficult. Our proposed transformer-based model learns a robust relevance function by jointly learning unified syntactic and semantic representations without the need for human labeled data. This is achieved by distantly supervising our model by distilling from predictions of a syntactic matching system on user queries and simultaneously training with CQA pairs. Training with CQA pairs helps our model learning semantic QA relevance and distant supervision enables learning of syntactic features as well as the nuances of user querying language. Additionally, our model encodes queries and candidate responses independently allowing offline candidate embedding generation thereby minimizing the need for real-time transformer model execution. Consequently, our framework is able to scale to large e-commerce QA traffic. Extensive evaluation on user queries shows that our framework significantly outperforms both syntactic and semantic baselines in offline as well as large scale online A/B setups of a popular e-commerce service.",https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.315,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,June,Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,"Mittal, Happy  and

All architectural factors that we investigated qualitatively affected how models generalized, including factors with no clear connection to hierarchical structure. For example, LSTMs and GRUs displayed qualitatively different inductive biases.

Disagreement is an important indication of these phenomena. Most traditional evaluation methods, however, critically hinge upon the notion of inter-annotator agreement. While alternative frameworks have been proposed, they do not move beyond agreement as the most important indicator of quality. Critically, evaluations usually do not distinguish between instances in which agreement is expected and instances in which disagreement is not only valid but desired because it captures the linguistic and cognitive phenomena in the data. We attempt to overcome these limitations using the example of a dataset that provides semantic representations for diagnostic experiments on language models. Ambiguity, vagueness, and difficulty are not only highly relevant for this use-case, but also play an important role in other types of semantic annotation tasks. We establish an additional, agreement-independent quality metric based on answer-coherence and evaluate it in comparison to existing metrics. We compare against a gold standard and evaluate on expected disagreement.

This motivates us to propose a new matching framework that can sufficiently carry important information in contexts to matching and model relationships among utterances at the same time. The new framework, which we call a sequential matching framework SMF, lets each utterance in a context interact with a response candidate at the first step and transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors are then accumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with a recurrent neural network RNN that models relationships among utterances. Context-response matching is then calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. Under SMF, we propose a sequential convolutional network and sequential attention network and conduct experiments on two public data sets to test their performance.

Since morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the analysis of a word w into its constituent segments and the synthesis of the meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of those morphemes.

In this work, we show that the cross-lingual performance of the parsers can be enhanced by over-generating the source language treebank. For this, the source language treebank is augmented with its perturbed version in which controlled perturbation is introduced in the parse trees by stochastically reordering the positions of the dependents with respect to their heads while keeping the structure of the parse trees unchanged. This enables the parser to capture diverse syntactic patterns in addition to those that are found in the source language. The resulting parser is found to more effectively parse target languages with different syntactic structures. With English as the source language, our system shows an average improvement of 6.7% and 7.7% in terms of UAS and LAS over 29 target languages compared to the baseline single source parser trained using unperturbed source language treebank.

Existing training approaches present a trade-off between large amounts of cheap data offered by the native-trained models and additional knowledge of learner error patterns provided by the more expensive method of training on annotated learner data. We propose a novel training approach that draws on the strengths offered by the two standard training paradigms-of training either on native or on annotated learner data-and that outperforms both of these standard methods. Using the key observation that parameters relating to error regularities exhibited by non-native writers are relatively simple, we develop models that can incorporate knowledge about error regularities based on a small annotated sample but that are otherwise trained on native English data. The key contribution of this article is the introduction and analysis of two methods for adapting the learned models to error patterns of non-native writers; one method that applies to generative classifiers and a second that applies to discriminative classifiers.

One major obstacle to researching this question is a lack of large labeled data sets for training automated classifiers to identify counter speech. Here we use a unique situation in Germany where self-labeling groups engaged in organized online hate and counter speech. We use an ensemble learning algorithm which pairs a variety of paragraph embeddings with regularized logistic regression functions to classify both hate and counter speech in a corpus of millions of relevant tweets from these two groups.

At the same time, there is a trend against not encoding the subject at all, leading us to postulate an overall tendency to encode familiar subjects once and only once in a neutral topiccomment utterance. This tendency is mirrored in more fine-grained corpus data from Slavic: East Slavic languages, in contrast to the other members of the genus, have past forms without verbal subject encoding, and it is precisely with these former participle forms that the use of independent subject pronouns is significantly higher than with other, non-participial verb forms.

Because historical collections are often sparsely annotated, much like our knowledge of history is incomplete, researchers often cannot know the underlying distributions of different document types and their various sub-classes. This means that bias is likely to be an intrinsic feature of training data when it comes to cultural heritage material. Our aim in this study is to investigate which classification methods may help mitigate the effects of different types of bias within curated samples of training data.

Several projects have attempted to classify uses of modal auxiliaries in corpora according to their reading using supervised machine learning techniques e.g., Rubinstein et al., 2013 , Ruppenhofer & Rehbein, 2012 . In each study, traditional taxonomic labels, such as 'epistemic' and 'deontic' are used by human annotators to label instances of modal auxiliaries in a corpus. In order to achieve higher agreement among annotators, results in these previous studies are reported after collapsing some of the initial categories. The results show that human annotators have fairly good agreement on some of the categories, such as whether or not a use is epistemic, but poor agreement on others. They also show that annotators agree more on modals such as might than on modals such as could. In this study, we used traditional taxonomic categories on sentences containing modal auxiliary verbs that were randomly extracted from the English Gigaword 4 th edition corpus Parker et al., 2009 . The lowest inner-annotator agreement using traditional taxonomic labels occurred with uses of could, with raw agreements of 42% − 48% κ = 0.196 − 0.259, compared to might, for instance, with raw agreement of 98%. In response to the low numbers, rather than collapsing traditional categories, we tried a new method of classifying uses of could with respect to where the reading situates the eventuality being described relative to the speech time.

With large parts of clinical information only documented in free text, NLP plays an important role in unlocking potentially re-usable and interoperable meaning from medical records in a multitude of natural languages. This study highlights the role of interface vocabularies. It describes the architectural principles and the evolution of a German interface vocabulary, which is under development by combining machine translation with human annotation and rule-based term generation, yielding a resource with 7.7 million raw entries, each of which linked to the reference terminology SNOMED CT, an international standard with about 350 thousand concepts. The purpose is to offer a high coverage of German medical jargon, in order to optimise terminology grounding of clinical texts by NLP systems. The core resource is a manually maintained table of English-to-German word and chunk translations, supported by a set of language generation rules. We describe a workflow consisting in the enrichment and modification of this table by human and machine efforts, together with top-down and bottomup methods for terminology population. A term generator generates the final vocabulary by creating one-to-many German variants per SNOMED CT English description. Filtering against a large collection of domain terminologies and corpora drastically reduces the size of the vocabulary in favour of terms that can reasonably be expected to match clinical text passages within a text-mining pipeline. An evaluation was performed by a comparison between the current version of the German interface vocabulary and the English description table of the SNOMED CT International release. An exact term matching was performed with a small parallel corpus constituted by text snippets from different clinical documents. With overall low retrieval parameters with F-values around 30%, the performance of the German language scenario reaches 80 -90% of the English one. Interestingly, annotations are slightly better with machine-translated German -English texts, using the International SNOMED CT resource only.",https://aclanthology.org/2020.multilingualbio-1.3,European Language Resources Association,2020,May,Proceedings of the LREC 2020 Workshop on Multilingual Biomedical Text Processing (MultilingualBIO 2020),"Schulz, Stefan  and

The present article has a twofold purpose: 1 it proposes a unifying statistical framework for modeling a/p entrainment, and 2 it tests on two large corpora of spontaneous telephone interactions whether three metrics derived from this framework predict positive social aspects of the conversations. The corpora differ in their spoken language, domain, and positive social outcome attached. To our knowledge, this is the first article studying relations between a/p entrainment and positive social outcomes in such large corpora of spontaneous dialog.

As the transduction of the lemma into the inflected form is dominated by copying over lemma characters, we propose two recurrent neural network architectures with hard monotonic attention that are strong at copying and, yet, substantially different in how they achieve this. The first approach is an encoderdecoder model with a copy mechanism. The second approach is a neural statetransition system over a set of explicit edit actions, including a designated COPY action.

However, for a given question, users sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction AQP aims to predict the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP systems either learn models using -a various hand-crafted features HCF or b Deep Learning DL techniques which automatically learn the feature representations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as -""Deep Feature Fusion Network DFFN"" which combines the advantages of both hand-crafted features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along with its metadata, a DFFN architecture independently -a learns features using the Deep Neural Network DNN and b computes hand-crafted features leveraging various external resources and then combines them using a fully connected neural network trained to predict the quality of the given answer. DFFN is an end-end differentiable model and trained as a single system. We propose two different DFFN architectures which vary mainly in the way they model the input question/answer pair -a DFFN-CNN which uses a Convolutional Neural Network CNN and b DFFN-BLNA which uses a Bi-directional LSTM with Neural Attention BLNA.

Problem-Oriented Policing POP is a potential replacement, at least in part, for traditional policing which adopts a reactive approach, relying heavily on the criminal justice system. By contrast, POP seeks to prevent crime by manipulating the underlying conditions that allow crimes to be committed. Identifying these underlying conditions requires a detailed understanding of crime events -tacit knowledge that is often held by police officers but which can be challenging to derive from structured police data. One potential source of insight exists in unstructured free text data commonly collected by police for the purposes of investigation or administration. Yet police agencies do not typically have the skills or resources to analyse these data at scale. In this article we argue that NLP offers the potential to unlock these unstructured data and by doing so allow police to implement more POP initiatives.

We focus on the task of aspect category classification and investigate whether including coreference information prior to classification to resolve implicit aspect mentions is beneficial. Because coreference resolution is not a solved task in NLP, we rely on both automatically-derived and gold-standard coreference relations, allowing us to investigate the true upper bound. By training a classifier on a combination of lexical and semantic features, we show that resolving the coreferential relations prior to classification is beneficial in a joint optimization setup.

Analysis of the online traces of trolls has shown different behavioral patterns, which target different slices of the population. However, this analysis is manual and laborintensive, thus making it impractical as a firstresponse tool for newly-discovered troll farms. In this paper, we show how to automate this analysis by using machine learning in a realistic setting. In particular, we show how to classify trolls according to their political role -left, news feed, right-by using features extracted from social media, i.e., Twitter, in two scenarios: i in a traditional supervised learning scenario, where labels for trolls are available, and ii in a distant supervision scenario, where labels for trolls are not available, and we rely on more-commonly-available labels for news outlets mentioned by the trolls. Technically, we leverage the community structure and the text of the messages in the online social network of trolls represented as a graph, from which we extract several types of learned representations, i.e., embeddings, for the trolls.

As a step toward AI systems that can build similar mental models, we introduce GLUCOSE, a large-scale dataset of implicit commonsense causal knowledge, encoded as causal minitheories about the world, each grounded in a narrative context. To construct GLUCOSE, we drew on cognitive psychology to identify ten dimensions of causal explanation, focusing on events, states, motivations, and emotions. Each GLUCOSE entry includes a storyspecific causal statement paired with an inference rule generalized from the statement. This paper details two concrete contributions. First, we present our platform for effectively crowdsourcing GLUCOSE data at scale, which uses semi-structured templates to elicit causal explanations. Using this platform, we collected a total of ˜670K specific statements and general rules that capture implicit commonsense knowledge about everyday situations. Second, we show that existing knowledge resources and pretrained language models do not include or readily predict GLUCOSE's rich inferential content.

In this study, we introduce a discourse mode annotated corpus for the low-resource Bengali also referred to as Bengali language. The corpus consists of sentence-level annotation of three discourse modes, narrative, descriptive, and informative of the text excerpted from a number of Bengali novels. We analyze the annotated corpus to expose various linguistic aspects of discourse modes, such as class distributions and average sentence lengths. To automatically determine the mode of discourse, we apply CML classical machine learning classifiers with ngram based statistical features and a finetuned BERT Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based language model. We observe that fine-tuned BERT-based model yields better results than CML classifiers.

In this paper, we address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a given budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually finetune a pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing active learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty scores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even when only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To address this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based machine translation PBMT era that selected not full sentences, but rather individual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT systems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need to be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of sentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to select both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the new domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation task, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over uncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score over strong active learning baselines. 1",https://aclanthology.org/2021.wmt-1.117,Association for Computational Linguistics,2021,November,Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Machine Translation,"Hu, Junjie  and

The corpus data yield inconsistent evidence with respect to the first hypothesis, but largely support the second one, suggesting that foreigner-directed speech is indeed simpler than native-directed.

In this paper, we proposed a new adversarial training method to leverage target monolingual data to relieve the lowresource shortcoming of speech translation.

Furthermore, statistics directly tied to prediction accuracy including perplexity may be confounded by the Zipfian nature of written language, as the majority of the prediction attempts will occur with frequently-occurring types. A model's performance may vary greatly between high-and low-frequency words, which in practice could lead to failure modes such as repetitive and dull generated text being produced by a downstream consumer of a language model.

It makes the call to urgently interrogate some of the ideologies behind those technologies, including issues of ethical and responsible development. The paper addresses four separate and interlinked issues: ideologies about deaf people and mediated communication, bias in data sets and learning, user feedback, and applications of the technologies. The paper ends with several take away points for both technology developers and deaf NGOs. Technology developers should give more consideration to diversifying their team and working interdisciplinary, and be mindful of the biases that inevitably creep into data sets. There should also be a consideration of the technologies' end users. Sign language interpreters are not the end users nor should they be seen as the benchmark for language use. Technology developers and deaf NGOs can engage in a dialogue about how to prioritize application domains and prioritize within application domains. Finally, deaf NGOs policy statements will need to take a longer view, and use avatars to think of a significantly better system compared to what sign language interpreting services can provide. 1 The writing of this paper has benefited from ongoing discussions on this theme as part of the EU COST Action network 'Language in the Human Machine Era' https://lithme.eu/",https://aclanthology.org/2021.mtsummit-at4ssl.2,Association for Machine Translation in the Americas,2021,August,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Automatic Translation for Signed and Spoken Languages (AT4SSL),"De Meulder, Maartje",Is ``good enough'' good enough?

We propose a method to diminish the problem of out-of-vocabulary words by introducing an embedding derived from syllables and morphemes which leverages the agglutinative property. Our model outperforms character-level embedding in perplexity by 16.87 with 9.50M parameters.

Currently, to get a measure of the language unit predictability, a neurolinguistic experiment known as a cloze task has to be conducted on a large number of participants. Cloze tasks are resource-consuming and are criticized by some researchers as an insufficiently valid measure of predictability.

This paper proposes a new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which analyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents-allowing for more intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under Bayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and information can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning applications.

We highlight the various features contributing to making PACTE an ideal platform for research projects involving textual annotation of large corpora performed by geographically distributed teams. Introduction With the availability of large amount of textual data on the web, or from legacy documents, various text analysis projects emerge to study, analyze and understand the content of these texts. Projects arise from various disciplines, such as psychological studies e.g. detecting language patterns related to particular mental states or literary studies e.g. studying patterns used by particular authors, or criminology studies e.g. analyzing crime-related locations. Text analysis projects of large scale often involve multiple actors, in a distributed spatial setting, with collaborators all over the world. While their perspectives are different and their goals are varied, most text analysis projects require some common functionalities: document selection to gather a proper corpus for pattern analysis, text annotation to mark actual metadata about documents, paragraphs, sentences, words or word segments and annotation search to search the annotated segments for the ones of interest. Furthermore, many projects would benefit from basic automatic annotation of textual components sentences, nominal compounds, named entities, etc. Yet, each project would likely also have its particularities as to what are the important text patterns to study, and perhaps such patterns are best annotated by human experts. We are in the process of developing a text project management and annotation platform, called PACTE http://pacte.crim.ca, to support such large-scale distributed text analysis. A key component of PACTE is to not only allow for easy annotation whether manual or automatic, but to also provide the very essential search component, to retrieve through the mass of texts, segments of information containing specific annotations e.g. retrieving all documents mentioning a particular city. In its final state, PACTE will contain the common required project management functionalities, as well as common annotation services, but also allow for particularities e.g. specialized schema definition. The platform also aims at encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations, as much automatic textual analysis in the recent years is data-driven, using machine learning models which require a lot of annotated data. A known bottleneck to these supervised models is the lack of availability of annotated data. By providing a platform which makes it easy to annotate using user-defined schemas, we hope to encourage various users from various disciplines to perform annotation. In the remaining of this demonstration note, we will show Section 2 an example of an annotation project with definitions of the various terms used when discussing annotation projects e.g. types, schemas, features, groups, etc. We will then highlight section 3 the distinctive features of PACTE, mainly focusing on eight important aspects of PACTE, that it 1 is web-based, 2 handles large volumes of text for both annotation and search, 3 allows easy project management, 4 allows collaborative annotation, 5 provides some automatic annotation services, 6 allows users to define specific schemas for targeted manual annotation,  7  provides text search capabilities, 8 offers management of custom lexicon.

While there exists a plethora of annotated linguistic information, these corpora are often not interoperable without significant manual work. Moreover, these annotations might have evolved into different versions, making it challenging for researchers to know the data's provenance. This paper addresses this issue with a case study on event annotated corpora and by creating a new, more interoperable representation of this data in the form of nanopublications. We demonstrate how linguistic annotations from separate corpora can be reliably linked from the start, and thereby be accessed and queried as if they were a single dataset. We describe how such nanopublications can be created and demonstrate how SPARQL queries can be performed to extract interesting content from the new representations. The queries show that information of multiple corpora can be retrieved more easily and effectively because the information of different corpora is represented in a uniform data format.",https://aclanthology.org/2020.law-1.2,Association for Computational Linguistics,2020,December,Proceedings of the 14th Linguistic Annotation Workshop,"Lek, Timo  and

The objective behind the creation of this corpus 1 is to fill the lack of resources concerning the resolution anaphora especially pronominal and verbal in the Modern Standard Arabic language and this is by creating a newly annotated corpus that we have called A 3 C which contains the anaphoric relations. To satisfy this objective, we created A 3 T, an anaphoric annotating tool that uses linguistic and statistical rules to automatically detect anaphors and their referents. After that, we resort to human specialists to verify and correct our A 3 T annotation's errors for the corpus's credibility. This study discusses novel features that can aid in determining the best reference, as well as the problem of the lack of resources for verbal anaphora.

As the process of manual eligibility determination is time-consuming, automatic structuring of the eligibility criteria into various semantic categories or aspects is the need of the hour. Existing methods use hand-crafted rules and feature-based statistical machine learning methods to dynamically induce semantic aspects. However, in order to deal with paucity of aspect-annotated clinical trials data, we propose a novel weakly-supervised co-training based method which can exploit a large pool of unlabeled criteria sentences to augment the limited supervised training data, and consequently enhance the performance. Experiments with 0.2M criteria sentences show that the proposed approach outperforms the competitive supervised baselines by 12% in terms of micro-averaged F1 score for all the aspects. Probing deeper into analysis, we observe domain-specific information boosts up the performance by a significant margin.",https://aclanthology.org/2020.clinicalnlp-1.27,Association for Computational Linguistics,2020,November,Proceedings of the 3rd Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop,"Dasgupta, Tirthankar  and
